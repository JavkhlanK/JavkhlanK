## Hi there 👋

Soo, you've wanted to take a look at my profile. Welcome!

## Who I am <img alt="A flushed emote as 3D-cube that's rotating" width="32" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JavkhlanK/JavkhlanK-backend/main/emotes/aflushcube.gif">

My name is Javkhlan (*amazing, right?*) and I'm a hobby programmer and like to mess around with tech.

My main tongue is German, but on the internet I often use English.

## What I do 🔭

I like [Android](https://android.com) a lot, that's why I work on projects running on/with it often.

I've always wanted to create my own app with a unique idea, or at least a unique design. That's yet to come.
I don't have lots of ideas, and that's kinda the reason why such an app doesn't exist yet. <img alt="A pensive emote doing a funny animation" width="16"  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JavkhlanK/JavkhlanK-backend/main/emotes/apensivefast.gif">
I'm mostly just trying around some cool libraries, or reading [docs](https://developer.android.com).

I'm currently working on [Sketchware-Pro](https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro).

<!--

Work in progress!

## Things I'm a fan of 😄

 * ISO 8601
   - Date and time representations differ worldwide, for example dates in German and English. ISO 8601 creates a unique standard which is easily distringuishable from most commonly found formats
