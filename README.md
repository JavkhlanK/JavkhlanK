## Hi there 👋

Soo, you've wanted to take a look at my profile. Welcome!

## Who I am

My name is Javkhlan (*Who would've thought so ⁉️*) and I'm a hobby programmer and like to mess around with tech.

My main tongue is German, but on the internet I often use English.

## What I do 🔭

I like [Android](https://android.com) a lot, that's why I work on projects running on/with it often.

I've always wanted to create my own app with a unique idea, or at least a unique design. That's yet to come.
I don't have lots of ideas, and that's kinda the reason why such an app doesn't exist yet.
I'm mostly just trying around some cool libraries, or reading [docs](https://developer.android.com).

I'm currently working on [Sketchware-Pro](https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro).
